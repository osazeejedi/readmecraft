PROMPT:
I want you to generate a complete GitHub project that helps me unlock multiple GitHub Achievements.

Project Goal

Create a JavaScript/TypeScript project called ReadmeCraft, which is a simple developer tool that generates README sections, badges, and starter templates. The project should be structured in a way that allows me to easily earn achievements like:

Starstruck

Pull Shark

YOLO

Quickdraw

Pair Extraordinaire

Automator

Galaxy Brain

(Optional) Open Sourcerer by adding the hacktoberfest topic
